  /**
  * Let us introduce a new operation called double xor, and use the operator ^^ to denote it.
  * For two integers A and B, A ^^ B is calculated as follows:
  * Take the decimal representations of A and B.
  * If they have different lengths, prepend the shorter one with leading zeros until they both have the same length.
  * Then, label the digits of A as a , a , 1  2 ..., a n (from left to right)
  * and the digits of B as b 1, b 2, ... , b n (from left to right).
  * C = A ^^ B will consist of the digits c1, c2, . . . , cn   ( from left to right ) , where
  * ci = (ai ^ bi)  % 10, where ^ is the usual bitwise XOR operator (see notes for exact definition) and x % y is the remainder of x divided by y.
  * If C happens to have any extra leading zeroes, they are ignored.
  *
  * When multiple ^^ operations occur in an expression, they must be evaluated from left to right. For example, A ^^ B ^^ C means (A ^^ B) ^^ C.
  *
  * @param  int  Number N
  * @return Return the value of N ^^ (N 足 1) ^^ (N 足 2) ^^ ... ^^ 1.
